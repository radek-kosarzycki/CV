	<div class="text" id="header">

		<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>
		<p>The fact that you are reading this letter means that probably I have sent out an application to your company hoping to secure a job position as a Front-end Developer. The first thing you should however know is that</p>
		<h1>I am not fit for the job that you have on offer. I am way under-qualified.</h1>
		<p> There - that is the honesty part done with.</p>
		<p> Let me try and persuade you </p>
		<h2>why you should consider hiring me anyway</h2> 
		<p>(that's some attitude, you have to admit)</p>
